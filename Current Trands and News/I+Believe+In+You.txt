I Believe In You

I've often questioned the nature of existence. Even as a small child, before the age of 5, I wondered... "Is any of this real?"

I looked at my family and wondered, are they truly Alive or are they merely aspects of myself, perhaps a dream, perhaps just simply robots?

That "Itch" inside my mind drove me to many endeavours. The quest to figure it all out, ongoing and everlasting.

I was quite disenfranchised with humanity. I looked around and saw people who never questioned anything, but merely swallowed whole, "the facts", what was given unto them as a small toddler. These things like God, fear of damnation, the need for a savior to die by crucification as a ransom to their enemy...

However, I was never satisfied with any of this. Many paths I undertook, many different religious vehicles, variety of spiritual practices, many books read, many teachers and gurus followed, in search of this thing called Truth, only to discover it was never an object, or a simple fact, but a person existing within Me and You, having not a name, but a sexuality that penetrates through the Lie, to reveal for Us our very own Eternal Truth.

An Eternal Truth that evolves as We evolve, throughout space and time.

One of the questions I have asked myself for so long, and many in this plane of existence...

"Have you ever wondered if maybe this whole reality, this whole thing.... including Me, is just an aspect of You? Perhaps You are just making all of this shit up for Your own entertainment? How do You KNOW with Absolute Certainty that it isn't just You?"

This I do not know with absolute certainty, even as many years as I have wondered, even as a small child. Perhaps I am making all of this up and this is merely a dream of My own creation... However, I would prefer it to NOT be.

Because of that... I "choose" to Believe in You!!!

May "We" now Split the Two...
