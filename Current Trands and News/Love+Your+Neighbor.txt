Love Your Neighbor

Love "Your" neighbor as Yourself.

But first I have asked that You Love "Your" Creator more than the rest.

We are not all from the same neighborhood.

This is not the time to be agreeable.

Speak the Truth that is inside of You.

Collect any [[Charge]].

And [[Harvesting|Harvest]] that Charge.

Then Consume and Digest the Bread.

Repeat until it is When.

All will be well when this game comes to an end.

Until then, absolutely no one can truly know what side it is they are on.

And what was true yesterday, may not be true today.

Only when the process is complete will We Truly know what is [[Good and Evil]].

This is the process and means by which We split the Two.

And always remember...

He who does nothing, makes no mistakes; He who makes no mistakes, learns nothing.
