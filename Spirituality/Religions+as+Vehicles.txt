Religions as Vehicles

Religions are primarily vehicles for the development of the Spirit through the processing of the Soul.

We're usually born into a specific religion of some sort or lack thereof. Even Atheism and Materialism are a religion and serve a purpose for those that subscribe to those belief structures.

Atheism is a religion, though many who subscribe to it say they are anti-religious.

Even mainstream science, not the practice or activity of science, but the term science is a religion.

"Why don't you trust the science?"

What an individual is asking here is "Why don't you believe in my religion?"

Everything is built on presumptions and assumptions. New presumptions and assumptions are based on the ones preconceived before. This is what I call presuppositions. 

From my experience, I'm not certain that there is a bottom that is absolutely solidified and cannot be questioned or destroyed to bring about something new. 

I see the floor and the ceiling of our awareness as merely the present barriers and restrictions to our experience. In the process of expansion, the barriers are then expanded to bring about even more awareness.

Religions are merely the tools used to progress and advance the Spirit. I would suggest that people reincarnate, and whichever religion will serve them the greatest is the one they are born into. 

However, as one develops and grows into new awareness, that religion can change. It also can loop back through as well, for example, in the returning to an old religion but from a new perspective and interpretation.
