It's my understanding that everything is a polarity.

I keep saying the bigger the charge, the bigger the gain.

And...

The deeper we dive, the higher we rise.

When it comes to Beauty and Disgust, the same polarity exists. We can only discover a higher level by diving deeper than what is currently known. Only then can the polar opposite be created and manufactured.

And this process is occurring lifetime after lifetime, in this expansion of knowledge and understanding into the whole Mystery of "Who am I?".

We cannot know the next level until we go into the next level. And it exists as a dual nature of polarity. There are two sides to every coin. Two sides to every polarity.

Nothing, at least when it comes to reality, can exist without its opposite, or at least its potential opposite. Doesn't necessarily mean we have to sleep in that,which is Ugly, to experience that which is Beautiful. But we must know them, and we cannot know one without knowing the other. 

In that, acceptance can then be obtained for both sides of the spectrum, and a preference can be brought forth.

Again, the deeper we dive, the higher we rise.
