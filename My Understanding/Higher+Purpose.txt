Higher purposes

In the nature of this existence, this life, the primary purpose is an evolution. We are attempting to move up - however, that path needs fuel, a motivation.

If we are primarily concerned with ourselves, trying to play it safe, not get hurt, and seek gratification only for our own appetites, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to move into anything substantial. We'd merely be spinning our wheels into nothingness.

This is why a higher purpose is necessary - without this, we will not have the power to push through, to overcome.

True growth is often quite terrifying. As it has been said, growth only occurs outside the comfort zone. I, however, am not suggesting that one should bite off more than one can chew. Incremental is the path, like going up stairs. One step at a time.

This higher purpose plays out in many ways for individuals. We can't suggest that one path is greater than another. This would be ignorance, for the path doesn't truly exist in the physical plane. 

For some, this may be in the process of family and children, others it may be their work, and for others it may be some great cause that they believe in. Perhaps even abstract concepts such as justice, beauty, love, and truth could be the fuel that is used to push one to move into the Unknown.

These vehicles are the necessary tools to transport our spirit into a higher evolution. It doesn't have to make logical sense; it really doesn't. It doesn't need to be rational, it really doesn't. I'd have to say the most impactful and life-changing scenarios in my life that I stepped into were anything but practical.

The Heart has its Love - in honoring that, we walk the path. We will not know with absolute certainty the purpose of this Love or even the outcome of walking this path until the end has come.

Higher Purpose - Live by it. Live under it. Progress because of it.
