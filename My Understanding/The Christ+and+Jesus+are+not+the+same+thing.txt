The Christ and Jesus are not the same thing

One thing that I think needs to be pointed out is that Jesus was not The Christ, absolutely not.

Did he have a relationship with The Christ? 

From what I perceive, it seems that way, but I'm not 100% certain. 

The things He said were of The Christ. However, the way it was presented, something is a little off in My eyes. 

I see Lies by omission - as You learn more, go back and read, You'll see what it is I see.

The Christ is a Spiritual Person with a Masculine Sexuality that lives within Us. 

Jesus is not and never was The Christ. He may have had a relationship with The Christ, though I can't be 100% certain on that.

They called him Jesus Christ - Jesus w/ The Christ is how I would interpret that. I can see truth in that.

But He’s not “The Christ”.

What I mainly want to present is that if and when Jesus comes back or returns, don't be fooled. 

He is not The Christ.

Any man or woman that makes that claim is of the Lie, and that includes Jesus.

The Christ is within Us, and it's through that Relationship that Our Truth is Eternally formed to then evolve through Space and Time.
