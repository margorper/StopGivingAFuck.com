Nothing is as it Seems

In my journey, I've worked hard to question absolutely everything I can question in my current capacity.

What is truly "True"?

What is truly "Real"?

And these questions, and the answers revealed, evolve continuously. Nothing is static.

There are layers upon layers to this reality and those beyond.

Perspectives, perceptions, and paradoxes unfold as new stories are told.

I think the hardest thing to achieve is giving up the Lie. I don't suggest that I am not still a servant or held in bondage to such lies, but I can say that I have removed myself from many, and my life has improved significantly along the way.

If interested in how to do that, check out my [[Harvesting Meditation]].

In that, that's the only way I've come to realize the fallacies I have held on to, or been indoctrinated with.

Jesus came and spoke of many things, many of which have been misinterpreted in my eyes, and a false religion was created from his life and his teachings. However, what he actually had and came to say, I find very fruitful, much truth revealed there, though at times, some things are hidden by omission. He spoke truth, but didn't provide the whole picture - this could be perceived as a Lie, but I would suggest it was necessary, absolutely necessary.

That said, even question what Jesus came to say or what he was trying to say...

Again and again, I've come to witness so many things that are not what is taught to us. This existence, the people within these systems of operation, so many things are just flat out wrong from what is truly going on.

Who am I? Who are We? What is "This" all about?

These are legitimate questions.Â 

Only those who seek are worthy to find.

I hold it to be True that Doubt and Uncertainty are of the Highest inherent personal values.

As soon as we think we "have" it, we've stepped off the path in discovering the Truth.
