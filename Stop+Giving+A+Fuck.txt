**Disclaimer**: All the ideas and concepts on this website are for entertainment purposes only. Though I attempt to share my ideas and concepts as honestly and as truthfully as I am capable of, I do not encourage nor recommend blind faith in any way.

This is merely the entertainment of ideas, and by the fruit of these ideas may they be judged.

**I consider myself a student** of the nature of reality, human relations, suffering, meditation, spirituality, religion, philosophy, jurisprudence, and other niche topics. Though I aspire to one day be a true philosopher and expert in ideas, I still consider myself a student.

I hold that doubt and uncertainty to be the highest of values. It is my conclusion that having complete certainty in anything is a good way to remove oneself from that path and quest towards Truth.

I do not hold any advanced degrees. I am not a professional in any capacity, including but not limited to psychiatry, psychology, theology, coaching, spirituality, yoga, or anything else for that matter, nor do I wish to be.

As they say, "We teach what we most need to learn." - I speculate that this is the nature of all true and great teachers, from Marcus Aurelius to even that of Jesus.Â 

I publish these ideas for my own learning, my own development, and most of all, for my own benefit.

**Read with intense discretion and personal discernment.**

That said - this is my site.

Not sure where to start?

I'd recommend my piece here called [[Harvesting Meditation]].
