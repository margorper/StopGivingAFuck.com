In the Beginning

I'm not specifically married to any specific school of thought or religious text. I speculate and derive my own opinions through reading, interpretation, and my meditations. I thought it might be useful to share my perception, perspective, and opinion on the creation story from the Bible. 

This will probably be in disagreement with many who have been raised in the faiths that correspond to this text. 

I speculate that this is because of the nature of the essence that I'll be discussing as I go through these few passages; that force or essence that I call sin by this doctrine. 

I believe this essence has spilled into the minds of those who lead these organizations and proclaim its truth. 

Again, I can only suggest that it has been interpreted in a way to benefit the essence or force that I can only refer to as [[Sin]].

Sin, to me, is a form of ignorance. It's not something that causes guilt, but the sin itself, this twisted and perversion of truth held deep within, causes the phenomenon that so many wish to avoid.

Is this good or bad? 

Well, that would depend on who defines what is good and what is bad - I'll speak on this concept later within this piece.

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. 
> **-John 1:1-5** from Bible

Oh my God?

or

Oh my Word?

Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! 

:) 

LOLz

I resonate with this verse when it comes to explaining the beginning. I see this concept of Word to mean many things simultaneously. However, for this specific approach, I'll refer it as the concept of Language itself and explain from that concept.

So we see here that the Word was there, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  I've come to the conclusion that the nature of reality, whether that be this physical plane or those existing outside this physical plane, are constructs of language. 

I use John 1:1-5 to justify or rationalize my opinion that this concept of God and Language/Word are synonymous, that being almost one in the same, if not simply one in the same. The construct of Language is God, and God is the construct of Language - at least when it comes to this reality and the ones we have the ability to access. 

We have Consciousness, this aliveness, this awareness, this capacity to Observe. An aspect of that is the imagination as well. We do have the ability to predict and perceive imagery and concepts that are not in the tangible and physical reality. Some of us have better and more developed imaginations than others. 

From my observations and experiments, it appears that this aspect of the imagination has the ability to simply come up with any answer to any question.

What's behind that rock? Before the rock is lifted, the answer is already created.

This would then explain my ideas around the wave and particle phenomenon in Quantum Physics and the Schrödinger's cat experiment.

This occurs in the physical plane, those outside the physical plane, as well as our internal and individualistic inner worlds. 

Asking questions always reveals answers. 

Those answers might not necessarily be true, yet this imagination seems to always come up with at least something. Something to fill the void. There simply cannot exists nothingness.

As I look back on my own experience, I seem to only be able to remember back when I began to learn a language. And because of that, and my study of NLP and other concepts regarding language, I've become quite stubborn that the phrase "Language creates reality" is a very real and literal statement.

>And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
>**-Genesis 2:7-8** 

Back to Genesis, we have the concept of the creation of Man. I find this interesting, as it appears to happen after the 7 days of initial creation. Only then was Man formed. 

Was it the 8th day? 

Perhaps many days after? 

It doesn't say.
>And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. And the Lord God **caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept:** and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
>**-Genesis 2:19-25**

So, sometime after the 7th day, we see that God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam. Woman was then created from this Sleeping Adam. 

Did Adam ever wake up?

From my personal experiences, meditations and experiments, I have concluded that the answer to that question is no. That's the only thing that can explain to me my experiences so that's the conclusion I've come to. Decide on your own.

Adam is asleep, and he is dreaming. 

We are in Adam, and Adam is in us.

That is my conclusion.

Many spiritual teachers talk about how we are all one. Others who lean into a more material reality say we are all completely separate. I've concluded that both of these answers are true and operate simultaneously. A true paradox, as I've come to conclude, exists along with many other paradoxes in this life, this reality.

>Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
>-**Genesis 3:1-5**

So, here is the beginning of the controversy. 

Many believe the serpent here is the devil or satan(adversary) or Lucifer. But, no where in the Book of Genesis do I see this serpent being referred to by any of these labels. These labels do not even present themselves at all in the Book of Genesis. 

So how is this determined? 

Where did this conclusion come from? 

And why is it so heavily propagated as an empirical truth in which all should live under, believe, and never ever question, for one shall surely perish?

I can only speculate that this concept of sin is the cause, the phenomenon that exists within us. 

An inversion of truth. 

A truth perverted?

In my meditations, it seems that truth is often turned upside down, or like structured in a perverted way, to make it not only false, but harmful. Because of this, I question the official narrative on the serpent and the role that it played, literally and/or metaphorically.

Next, we have here, the concept of knowing good and evil. I think this can be a difficult concept for many to grasp because often what defines good and evil for the common individual is merely a bitter taste in their belly(that gut wrenching feeling) or the absence thereof. 

To give a hint towards maybe a future post, I'll share with you this verse from the Book of Revelations, but I'll have to come back to that at another time. I just want you to notice the word Bitter, and maybe speculate on your own of what this entails, what it is actually trying to communicate if you are interested in reading this chapter, or maybe the whole book, on your own and investigate.

>And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly **bitter**, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. 
>**- Revelation 10:9** from the Bible

Back to the Book of Genesis now.

So we see here that the serpent explains that if they eat thereof they will then be as gods, knowing good and evil.

But what is good and evil fundamentally?

For free will to fully exist, agency, sovereignty, I would suggest that Good merely means that which is in alignment with one's personal goals and endeavors. Evil, however, would be the opposite, that which opposes one's personal goals and endeavors. 

However, if someone is subservient to a master, then they do not have agency. So Good and Bad would be defined by the hierarchy they exist within, by the one directly above the subservient. 

This would then entail a lack of agency, a lack of free will.

This would then be counter to the whole mainstream argument of who the serpent is and what this story is actually about.

>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
>**-Genesis 3:6-7**

So here we come into first contact with human suffering. They experience a sensation. I would speculate in their belly, making them uncomfortable. They do not know what to do but wish to escape this horrible feeling. The mind now active, by this sensation, triggers and begins to rationalize and justify and answer questions to their concerns.

I am naked? (who told you that?!?) 

What should I do? (why are you asking that?!?)

This rationalizing and justifying fires off and begins the process of building explanations on a false and predisposed false logic, an untruth. They then cover themselves for they felt "ashamed".

Again, above. Ask a question, get an answer. This is the nature of mind.

And this is interesting.

>And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
>**-Genesis 3:8-10**

Here, we have the rationalizing and justifying process starting out. They hide. 

Why? 

Shame - which is an uncomfortable feeling in one's belly.

>And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
>**-Genesis 3:11-12**

Again, we see the rationalizing and justifying. 

What is this? 

Why are they operating this way?

From my observation, this is when they have entered into the mind. 

Some would call it the ego, which is fair. 

This rationalizing and justifying, it's building evidence and excuses on top of a false foundation. The preconceived lie exists and is solidified by a negative sensation - what I would call a [[Charge]]. 

The running away from the negative sensation is what holds it in place and builds conclusions on top of more lies. Then lies upon those lies.

The charge spins up, and the energy from that charge then starts the internal dialogue, which then builds the formation of more untruths on top of the foundation of untruth. This formulates beliefs which are built on already well-established false conclusions. 

Assumptions and presumptions.

This then relates to my opinion of Matthew 7:24-27

>Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.
>**-Matthew 7:24-27**

From my observations and interpretations, storms and waters are often, if not always, metaphors for emotion. Negative Emotions, more often than not, more especially within the context of a storm.

Back to Genesis

>13 And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.14 And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy **belly** shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
>**-Genesis 3:13-15**

So we see here again some of the rationalizing and justifying taking place by the woman in this part of the story. She blames the serpent. But why does she blame the serpent? What is motivating her? Why does she care?

Because she feels uncomfortable.

Then we see the sentencing or punishment to the serpent. 

Who is the serpent? 

Why is the serpent there? 

And I could say further, who or what force is the being within the serpent?

The serpent is there, yet Adam is deep asleep? 

Or is he?

How do we know with absolute certainty?


>Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
>**-Genesis 3:16**

Here, we have the introduction of conflict between "individuals". I quote the word individuals in reference to something I said above if you didn't quite catch it.

>And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for **thy sake**; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
>**-Genesis 3:17**

"For thy Sake"... 

For Adam's sake, right?

What's that about?

"in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life" it says. 

Ok? 

What is the source of this sorrow? 

Eat?

Eat it?

Is sorrow suffering? 

And is suffering merely the bitter feeling in one's belly?

>Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; In the sweat of thy face **shalt thou eat bread**, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
>**-Genesis 3:18-19**

Bread? 

Eat Bread? 

What is this Bread?

>After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. **Give us this day our daily bread**. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
>**-Matthew 6:9-13**

Give us our Daily Bread? 

Again, what is this bread?

And where does bread go?

>And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
>**-Genesis 3:20-21**

So the Lord God Banished them but clothed them in coats of skin? 

What's that about?

>And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is **become as one of us, to know good and evil**: and now, **lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever**:
>**-Genesis 3:22**

Become "one" of "us"?

"lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever"?

For ever....?

What's that about?

Chapter 3 ends with the following...

>23 Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
>**-Genesis 3:23-24**

To conclude, use your own head and think for yourself. 

As for me.... 

Adam is still asleep. This universe is actually his body (rib). We're all inside Adam and Adam is within us(the observer within our self). 

They keep talking about this bread stuff, daily bread, sorrow from bread, and all that. In my belly, feels bitter...  yet it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey?

Again, Daily Bread, sorrow and suffering, "In the sweat of thy face **shalt thou eat bread**, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."

And yet... what did Jesus say and for what purpose?

**Give us this day our daily bread**.

Have fun with that!!!
