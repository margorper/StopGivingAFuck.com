The Lord's Prayer

In the Bible, there is this event in which Jesus instructs how one should pray.

Chapter 6 of Matthew is very interesting, and there is a lot going on here within the scope of my own eyes. However, verse 9 begins this prayer that is colloquially known as the Lord's Prayer.

>Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.

The whole chapter contains many Mysteries, and this prayer has so many levels and layers of understanding applied to it. I personally see it as a metaphysical prayer, meaning it is speaking to and of the existence of a higher plane. That said, I interpret the meaning behind it quite differently than those I interact with on a day-to-day basis.

"Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name." - In my eyes, this is instruction and affirmation to perceive the holiness that bleeds from top to down. That which comes from above symbolically and is then interpreted in the physical plane in the form of events and circumstances.

"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven." - Similar to above, but more transparent. At the same time, we have our own unique and individualized interpretations of what God, Father, Creator, is. I would suggest that interpretation has a significant influence on our experiences and the meanings we define to those experiences within the scope of this reality.

"Give us this day our daily **bread**." - Again, very interesting.

>19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat **bread**, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. -Genesis 3:19 from the Bible

Here we get into the nature of suffering, this idea this this plane of existence, we shall/must suffer. This goes into the book of Genesis - I did write a piece on my ideas related to that which can be seen here, [[In the Beginning]].

In my eyes, what Jesus is referring to when he is describing **bread** is not food. Often, it is my understanding that most believe this is a request for food and substance to stay alive. I disagree. I suggest what he is requesting is the nature of a [[charge]]. Through that charge, it's possible to overcome the nature of [[Sin]]. To fully comprehend my perspective on that, see [[Chart of Emotions]] and [[Harvesting Meditation]].

"And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors." - Some translations, the word trespass is used instead of debts, others use transgressions which simply means an offense. This is extremely deep and I would suggest quite difficult for people to comprehend. 

We have the word "**as**" in "forgive us our trespasses, **as** we forgive those who trespass against us." 

To fully comprehend my understanding of this, I'd suggest my piece on [[Solipsism]] and my piece called [[Two Sides - One Coin]].

This can be difficult to swallow. I hold that there are a lot of variables in place when it comes to circumstances and events, and even deeper still, how we interpret those events and respond and react to those events.

And I would suggest it is only through the nature of [[Repentance]] can this be fully realized. It appears in my observations and experiences that [[Birds of a Feather]] flock together. And this can be so difficult to perceive with our own nature of [[Sin]]. 

We are so overly focused on separation and blaming what is outside, finding some form of satisfaction in playing the victim, that we cannot perceive how we may, and often are, responsible for the events in our lives. Again, this can be difficult to swallow and very confusing if attempted to consume and digest too soon. 

Let us not bite off more than we can chew.

But the cause of all causes, and that which exists within our Heart, from my observations leads to the trespasses. We are ignorant, we don't know what to do; we fail in some area of understanding, which leads to suffering and misery. 

This is an ongoing process.

Fundamentally, this concept of Father and asking to forgive our trespasses “as” we forgive those that trespass against us. It's like an equation almost, X=Y, but on a higher plane, which then bleeds down and into the physical plane. 

What we don't undo, we will go through. 

What we resist not only persists but grows. 

I think my piece on [[Implied Consent]] would help explain this at a higher level.

This concept of a trespass, is not necessarily a specific behavior. But a theme existing within the scope of a higher plane. I attempt to describe this in [[Two Sides - One Coin]] and [[Birds of a Feather]].

We may not be guilty of the specific behavior, "I would never do that." but I would suggest we are often, if not always, guilty of the over extending theme, the Cause of Causes. The manifestation of the behavior from that Cause may show itself very differently, but the fundamental [[Sin]] is present within our own Heart. 

The trick is learning how to perceive it and becoming a witness to it. Overcoming our own blindness.

>7 Judge not, that ye be not judged. 2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. 3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? 5 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye. 
>**-Matthew 7:1-5** from the Bible

"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil:" - Temptation? What is that? 

I would suggest that temptation is the concept of seduction brought forth by [[Spilling]] due to a [[Clutch]]. This process builds more lies on top of the foundation of lies that already exist within us. 

We are asking to not be seduced by that so we can penetrate through the lie and then establish our identity, our foundation, our "Home" on a rock, or at least something with more substance in regards to truth. 

For more on this, see my piece [[The Truth Will Set You Free]].

"For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen." - Affirmation here, the desire to hold a beneficial and loving perspective of the individual's Creator. 

This has such a significant influence on our lives in so many ways. What we hold to be true of our Creator will manifest in our responses and interpretations and will have the most significant influence over our lives.

For more ideas on this view of the Creator and the influence it has over us, I'd recommend my piece [[Going Up The Chain]].
