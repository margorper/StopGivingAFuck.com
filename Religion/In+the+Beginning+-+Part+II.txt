In the Beginning - Part II

I would suggest that existence is a little more complicated than we have been led to believe. I shared some of my ideas in my piece called [[In the Beginning]], but I'd like to dive further, deeper still.

There a lot of players in the game. We have this God, the creator of "this" physical reality. We have Adam. Adam is placed in a deep sleep and during that process Eve, his companion is then created as well, that being within the Dream. 

Metaphorically, I see this as the creation of Separation. In the story of Genesis, the beginning, we then see the serpent, the messenger, come into play as well.

Again, there are a lot of players in this aspect of creation, existence, and life itself.

I think a fundamental aspect to all of this can be found in Genesis 3. Whether this is a reality or not, literal, I cannot say. But I do hold it to be truthful spiritually, which I would suggest holds much higher significance.

>3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. **-Genesis 3:3** from the Bible

This is in reference of Genesis 2:17

>17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. **-Genesis 2:17** from the Bible

Again, back to the Serpent's communication, his message.

>4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. 6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. 7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. **-Genesis 3:4-7** from the Bible

They did eat of the fruit, yet they did **not** die.

We can then see that the concept that they would die was a lie.

However, what they did step into was self-consciousness. And the original lie had already been planted, installed, and so now they were fearful. This then led to their shame, an effect of the fear planted by the lie. They stood before God and felt ashamed. 

But who lied? It wasn't the serpent, this messenger, but it was this one they called God. The God of this reality, the God of this specific creation. He was the liar.

But it's more complicated than that.

Was God wrong in lying?

I'm reminded of an old maxim of law, "Let he who wishes to be deceived, be deceived."

I would suggest yes, God did lie to his creation, but was it wrong? 

Did he lie to his creation, or did he lie for his creation?

Was he being bad, selfish, and narcissistic, and all the bad labels that many would place on someone engaging in this behavior?

Again, it's more complicated, this process of creation. 

There are many players in the game.

I look at human beings as an organism, a culture of bacteria, for example. It is cultivated, it is grown. But much like **bread** is created, there must be a catalyst, yeast, for example. It creates the bubbles, the chemical reaction, for the flower and water to then come into something ultimately good, to be the bread, that which sustains life.

We can also see this in Machine Learning and AI. This idea of nodes, representative of cells in the brain. In this process of bouncing ideas back forth, the organism grows, learning takes place, something new comes into being. We humans are cells in the mind of Adam.

That said, yes, God did lie. 

He lied. He lied. He Lied. He Lied. He lied. He lied. He Lied. He Lied.

The Serpent didn't lie, but God did lie.

But does that make God, of this reality, bad?

I would say no, not at all.

God wasn't wrong or bad for what he did. In a way, it was his own sacrifice. 

Whether that sacrifice was being or is being made consciously or unconsciously, that I cannot decide, or know. 

To fully understand that, I'd have to go more into the nature of physical reality. 

But yes, this was a sacrifice, in a way, I would suggest a willing sacrifice. 

Then God saw in the serpent that which he could not see within himself... his own shadow... a projection of what he denied about himself, his own rejection.

>14 And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: 15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. **-Genesis 3:14-15** from the Bible

God is not above duality, at least this God. He could see what was good and what was evil in his own eyes. He had preferences, and he knew what was in alignment with his goals(good) and what was not in alignment with his goals(evil). 

This is what was given to mankind by means of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, by means and way of the Serpent, the original messenger, so they(humanity) too could become like Gods.

>22 And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 23 Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. **-Genesis 3:22-23** from the Bible

Whether this was planned by some greater intelligence than the God of this creation, or whether God, in fact, knew what he was participating in for that Greater Good. That I cannot say, only that it was for the Greater Good.

Here we can see that even these lies could be used for good.

For all things are good for those who love God.

Again, often things are rarely what they seem. 

Things are not as simple as we have been told or led to believe. 

There are many players in the game. 

All serve a purpose in and within themselves.
