The Greatest Commandment

One of the teachings of Jesus from the Bible was on the concept of Law. People were basically wondering what is the greatest sin, and which one would give them the most favor, or something like that. He spoke and said...

>36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law? 37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. 38 This is the first and great commandment. 39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. **-Matthew 22:36-40** from the Bible

I find this passage to be most interesting for a number of reasons. I will attempt to share my thoughts and ideas.

First, we could look at this in a literal translation. He says that loving your creator is the first and great commandment, then next, love your neighbor as yourself. This is valuable insight for many reasons.

On the loving your Creator first - if this is not in place, as it is with many, they are easily swayed and manipulated. 

This, I would suggest, is the great cause for much suffering. 

Many speculate that to be Christian(by the mainstream definition, not mine) is to be all-loving. When this is installed as a core belief, this fallacy then leads to people-pleasing. People-pleasing then leads to a lowered level of self-respect. Continued, self-respect will be completely abolished. This then leads to severe depression and massive frustration and apathy.

The love of your Creator is a safety mechanism to keep this from happening.

The other concept is that our life force flows through from our Creator. If we place other peoples' needs and wants before our Creator, we bleed out. This is what I describe as having holes in the ego, the identity. 

The love spills out. 

Other people might like it, but eventually, this will lead to extreme apathy.

Next, we can look at the love your neighbor as yourself. He says, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Shalt is akin to shall, which means must. It's an absolute.

This gets into a higher understanding. To start off with something simple, I think most people would agree that we receive what we give. This gets into the nature of consent on a higher plane. If we consent to stealing from our neighbor, we consent to our neighbor stealing from us. If we consent to covet our neighbor's house, car, friends, romantic partner(s), and having ill will towards them, feeling envy, jealousy, and having all sorts of wicked thoughts, that may possibly turn into wicked actions. If we do that, we consent to the same being done to us.

Now at another level of understanding, we can look at what Jesus was saying when he spoke of the Law as an actual law., like the law of gravity or laws of physics. We can interpret this in another way, not on what is "good" and "bad", that being this concept on what can we do to avoid being punished and instead rewarded, but to simply interpret what he was saying as simply the nature of this reality.

To phrase this differently, "You will love your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind." And next, "You will love your neighbor as you love yourself."

What is an individual's God? 

That which they hold most dear.

If it's an individual's car, or business, or their money, or what have you -they will lash out, and possibly damage their neighbor in sacrifice to protect their God. 

This is a given, and we see it every day. 

That God might be their own ego and the lies they find comfort in. It could be many things. But whatever it is that is our God, that will be what rules over us. 

Our priority is our God.

Next, to step into the concept of "You will love your neighbor as you love yourself" - and notice how he says neighbor, not people in general, or brother, or anything like that, but specially neighbor. We can observe this as not a choice in right or wrong, good and evil, but merely a law of nature. To the degree, the essence, of how we treat our neighbor is a reflection of how we treat ourselves.

If we bash our neighbor, if we try to impose our will on our neighbor, if we violate the boundaries of our neighbor, we are also doing that to ourselves.

In the above, I spoke about the nature of consent. If we consent to coveting our neighbor and thus having ill will and wicked thoughts about them because of what they possess, we consent to the same being done to us. Yet in this understanding, "will" in the scope of a natural law, this will happen, you will love your neighbor as you love yourself. This will take place. 

This gets into the concept of self-respect and boundaries. If you don't have boundaries, you will lack the capacity to recognize the boundaries in others. If you do not respect yourself, you will lack the capacity to respect others.

Again, you will love your neighbor as yourself.

And to take it a step further, who are you? We see this concept of the neighbor. I would suggest, and am quite confident, that we are not all from the same neighborhood, and that's OK. 

>22 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. 
>**-Matthew 6:22** from the Bible

Rid yourself of confusion, of being divided by double-mindedness, this indecisiveness, caused by the Great Manipulation. 

Only then will one know the way.
