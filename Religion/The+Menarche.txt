The Menarche 

The Menarche is in reference to a female's initial first menstrual cycle. This concept of the period.

The Menarche starts the process of ovulation - before the Menarche, it is normally not possible for impregnation to take place.

Before the Menarche, there is no egg that is released that can be fertilized.

Reality is quite strange, and from my observation Fractal by nature. We see these symbols and themes throughout reality. Higher still, we have other planes of existence. 

The Spiritual Plane is the Cause of all Causes, from there, information, these symbols and themes, bleed down into the Physical Reality. Here they are expressed in a physical form.

It's easy to take things very literal when we are seduced or hypnotized by this physical plane. We cannot see beyond this.

The story of Jesus and what all this is about, it has to do with something occurring on a higher plane. That is then represented in the Physical Plane, in which we come to conclusions on what it could mean.

This idea of the Begotten Son of God, goes into this idea of the seed of God. God's Sperm.

To get more understanding on that, see [[Truth]].

The Passion - the crucifixion, the bleeding - the Menarche.

That which was raised? I think you get it.

The Second Coming - the Birth of something New. A new creation.

The gestation period, or length of pregnancy, is the time between conception and birth, when an embryo or fetus develops within the mother's womb.

How long does it take? 

That depends on the being.

These things we are talking about are the processes of creation.
