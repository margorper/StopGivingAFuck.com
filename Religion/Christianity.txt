Christianity

I was raised Protestant, went to Catholic School, hung out with Catholics, dropped out of all that at the age of 16. Explored many religions in my 20s and 30s. In my mid to late 30s, I explored Orthodoxy. Eventually, I dropped out of that as well.

I respect the Bible, and I like to think I can intellectually hang and converse with just about anyone in the Christian school of thought, no matter what denomination or sect they may belong to.

As with all religions, I believe there does exists inherit value, truths to be found, within all these different perspective within and under the umbrella referred to as Christianity.

At the same time, I do have very strong disagreements with the term Christianity, the nature of Jesus, the Trinity, and all that, compared to most I interact with and within these perspectives. 

With that, I make the strongest attempt I can to have and hold empathy and come from a place of understanding that [[Religions as Vehicles]] is in fact real, and whatever mode or paradigm one needs to exists in is significantly important to them and what it is that they need to achieve or go through.

My personal definition of Christianity is simply being one who follows Christ. 

I analyze the teachings of Jesus, which I debate whether it is Jesus the ego/identity speaking these things or something beyond flowing through his vessel and speaking through him.

To me, the Idea of Christianity and being a follower of Christ encompasses or entails the following three priorities.

First - To love "your" Creator above all.

Second - To love "your" neighbor as yourself.

Third - To pick up “your” cross and follow the path, as Jesus said, "me". Again, is that Jesus, or something within flowing through him? My assumption is strongly leaned towards the latter.

If interested in more on this specific topic, check out my piece [[The Greatest Commandment]].

These 3 priorities, listed by significance in priority, are what I perceive to be a path rather than an actual religion. 

I question a lot of the religious ideas within the scope of what I call mainstream Christianity. 

Did Jesus die on the cross to save humanity from damnation? I have my significant doubts on that idea and would lean towards the concept that he died for speaking the truth, but even deeper, because it is the [[Will]] of his Creator.

This gets into the concept of [[Implied Consent]], allegiance, and removing one's self from being [[The Truth Will Set You Free|manipulated]].

>And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. 
>**-Matthew 26:39** from the Bible

And why would this be necessary? 

And why would Jesus volunteer to go through this? 

That's a hard topic to get into and I think it would take a significant level of experience and understanding of the Self and of this Reality to comprehend - at least to see it the way I see it.

What we resist not only persists but grows. - Carl Jung

What we don't undo, we will go through. - not sure who said this, but it comes to mind.

To get an idea of what I really think about all this stuff and what was really going on, whether it was real or merely a metaphor and allegory to describe the path, I look at the Gospel of Thomas, which is considered a Gnostic Text. 

I personally lean more in that direction than the mainstream interpretation of what Jesus's role was and what was going on within the context of the Crucifixion. 

I see these things as what I would call Mysteries.

>"Everyone who seeks should continue seeking until he finds. When he finds, he will be troubled at the contemplation of Truth, but when he has passed through the time of trouble, he will be astonished at the brightness of the Light, for the Way of Truth is the Pathway to the Eternal Godhead, and the price of the beatific vision is the wringing of the soul. **The person who desires to rise above all things must descend below all things**, for the way to the heights passes through the depths of anguish, which generate the fires of Life. The person who has suffered and found Life is blessed." 
>**-Gospel of Thomas 1:2**

 My personal phrase is, "The deeper we dive, this higher we rise." and this has to do with the nature of Spirit and its potential and desire to comprehend an identity, "Who am I?", as well as growing in capacity within its nature to create reality and existence.

Another phrase I came up with is, "The bigger the [[Charge]], the bigger the Gain." Same as above - the more willing we are to voluntarily and willingly enter into the Cross, the third priority, the greater our own unique individualized capacity moves into expansion.

>The disciples questioned Jesus concerning the Way of Life: "How should we fast? In what manner should we pray? How should our alms be given? What dietary law should we observe?" Jesus said, "I will instruct you in all these matters, **but first you must put off your love of the lie, the false way of life followed by the children of this plane of existence, and be converted, changed so that you hate that which you have previously loved, and love that which you have previously hated. Then I will be able to show you all things**, for there is nothing hidden which will not be manifested when you have put on the mind of Truth." 
>**-Gospel of Thomas 1:11**

Love what you once hated, and hate what you once loved, only then can we see pass the illusion, the corrupted lens that I call [[Sin]].

To comprehend that, I’d recommend my piece called [[Harvesting Meditation]].

>Mary of Bethany asked him, "Will the thirst for knowledge ever be quenched?" Jesus said, "When once you have drunk from the spring of knowledge, you will return again and again, for each time your thirst is satisfied, a new thirst will grow, greater than the first. The more you drink, the greater will be your desire to drink, but in the intensity of your desire, you will be filled. I tell you the truth when I say that whoever seeks will find, and the finding will cause him to seek, but **in the seeking is hidden the meaning of Life.**" 
>**-Gospel of Thomas 1:12**

In the seeking is hidden the meaning of life - We see this everywhere, for example, "Unattached to the outcome, but committed to the process."

There is no finish line, no ultimate goal. Only movement into the infinite and eternal Mystery.

Back to the question of why it would be Jesus's Creator's Will for him to go through this.

"What we don't undo, we will go through." 

Jesus was asking if there was another way to achieve the Will, but it didn't play out that way. 

I personally believe that Jesus's greater desire was to fulfill the will, and that's why he spoke in the format and the syntax that he spoke - to fulfill the will. 

Why though?

To move beyond his own limitations. He wanted to move into the next level, which was his Creator's Will; it was the only way it could be achieved, or the easiest way.

In my meditations and my interactions in other planes of existence, whether those experiences are real or just my own imagination, with what we could call the Saints, it's my understanding that ultimately, "He did it for himself... and Not for anyone else"—and that's OK because, in the end, we ALL do it to and for ourselves.
