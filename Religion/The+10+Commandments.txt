The 10 Commandments

I want to make an attempt to give an alternative perspective on the 10 commandments and what's being put in place here, what this was about, and what purpose it serves.

I cannot say or suggest that any of this was even real. This story of Moses going up on a mountain, receiving tablets etched with these commandments, or anything of that nature. 

We can hold faith that it was real and that it happened, but I personally don't think that is relevant from what has been provided and the concepts described.

I perceive much of the religious texts out there, from the Bible to those of the Hindu religion and many others, to primarily be speaking of things that are not necessarily in the physical plane. 

They are describing something that exists in a higher plane, often symbolically. This then bleeds down into the physical plane. Being that the cause of the physical plane exists in the higher planes, these forces or understandings have an effect on our experiences and expressions in this world.

First, let's lay out the 10 commandments, then I will go through them, from my interpretation, my understanding. I list here the whole chapter because I have some commentary on the parts after the 10 commandments section as well.

**Exodus 20** - Whole Chapter

>20 And God spake all these words, saying, 2 I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 3 **(1)** Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 4 **(2)** Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; 6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. 7 **(3)** Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 8 **(4)** Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: 11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. 12 **(5)** Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. 13 **(6)** Thou shalt not kill. 14 **(7)** Thou shalt not commit adultery. 15 **(8)** Thou shalt not steal. 16 **(9)** Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. 17 **(10)** Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's. 18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off. 19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. 20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. 21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was. 22 And the Lord said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. 23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold. 24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee. 25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. 26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.

So, according to this story, we had this event. Moses is on the mountain and is informed of these 10 commandments by which his people are to abide.

I've spoken with many in the field of religion, from pastors, priests, theologians, and students in seminary school. One of the main patterns I see is this idea that this God is a person with an ego, and it has preferences and conditions in that it places on its creation. A failing to live in accordance with these rules then leads to damnation - the concept of hell, which is a place of misery.

I fundamentally disagree with this stance and position. Instead, I suggest that the 10 commandments are metaphysical in nature, and the failure to live in accordance with them is actually a symptom of ignorance. The concept of sin is ignorance in that the idea of sin is a reference to missing the mark, being off target.

The first commandment, we have this expressed as **(1)** Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 

This word, shalt, I see to be akin to shall, which basically means must. In my past research on the definition of words and etymology and all that, my investigation led me to interpret this word "gods" to actually refer to authorities. I would suggest the allegiance to authorities that have no merit, are not chosen by free will, or of voluntarily persuasion is what this commandment is in reference to. Not things necessarily in other dimensions or the ether. 

My interpretation then is this commandment is expressing this concept of don't put your trust in security in anything outside of yourself. Do not trust in something external from your Creator.

The word “gods” here is in reference to bending the knee, bending one's back, being manipulated by something external. This manipulation is caused by a form of ignorance, a symptom of sin.

The second commandment, we have **(2)** Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; 6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

In this - what I perceive is something that is done quite often and is quite normal. This is the participation in attempting to define what God is. The act of making an image is placing God in a box. Suggesting God is this and God is not that. We see this all the time, and I would suggest that many who speak passionately about the 10 commandments and adhering to them for fear of being punished are actually violating the 2nd commandment unknowingly.

The third commandment, we have **(3)** Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

In this, we think of the word vain. I could interpret this in a couple of different ways. 

Vain being a word referring to useless, and from that stance, I see that in the action of frivolous behavior - doing things that are unproductive and lack purpose. 

The other interpretation I can see is the concept of blaming God, blaming an outside force for current circumstances. This would suggest a core belief that we cannot trust in a higher power and that we do not perceive our circumstances as being a tool for our progression. 

Again, I would suggest that this behavior is a symptom of sin. It's not the behavior that is the sin - an action that needs to be reprimanded or punished. Instead, in the cycle of sin, we make choices that result in our own misery.

The fourth commandment, we have **(4)** Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: 11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

So we have this idea of the sabbath, this day of rest. To use the teachings of Jesus to support my stance on this, I'll share Mark 2:24-28

>24 And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful? 25 And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? 26 How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? 27 And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: 28 Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. 
>**-Mark** 2:24-28 from the Bible

So here we see this concept that I am talking about. The violation of the 10 commandments, the failure to live in accordance with them, all this stuff, it's nothing to do with this concept of God's desire to be a dictator. 

The sabbath itself was made for man, not man for the sabbath. 

If one is unwilling to take time off and reflect and be in peace, meditate, pray or whatever, I would suggest that stems from ignorance. Workaholism, the running away from one's self, the violation of personal boundaries, the act of [[Bleeding Out]]. 

When people are so obsessed with running and running, it stems from some form of manipulation that exists within. This manipulation being a lie, an aspect of the sin.

The fifth commandment we have  **(5)** Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. 

This gets into some of my more esoteric ideas that might, at first glance, not be in alignment with my metaphysical stance. So my theory here is that the caregivers in one's life are chosen for the lifetime to assist in learning lessons, development, and all that. 

I think in some sects of Gnosticism, they suggest that the primary caregivers are symbols for how the demiurge views the individual - that being the views of the child in the early stage of development, before puberty. So whatever the primary view the child has towards their parents before puberty is how the demiurge feels about the spirit that exists in the child. This can be an interesting concept.

To take it a step down, that relationship and learning to deal with it is an aspect of the development process. Suffering within the scope of that relationship will show the sin, the lies, that produce the weak results.

Take it from another angle; we could think about DNA and how we are the product of our parents, whether we like it or not. To reject our parents is to reject ourselves. A lack of self-acceptance is, again, a symptom of ignorance.

At a higher plane, and what I hold to be the Truth of what is said. We have our own Creators within the Spiritual Plane. A Mother and Father that is true to our origin and what it means to be You. In this, Honor thy Father and Mother who truly Love us. When this is fully realized, the parents of the lies of this physical plane, can simply be ignored.

The sixth command we have **(6)** Thou shalt not kill. Some translations say thou shalt not kill. Others say thou shalt not murder. This can be a little bit of a deeper subject matter. So I'm sure we can all remember Jesus speaking to one of his disciples, live by the sword, die by the sword.

>52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. 
>**-Matthew 26:52** from the Bible

This gets into the nature of consent, but I would suggest that the consent is not based on action, such as [[Implied Consent]], but on the structures of belief existing in the heart. So if an individual has it within themselves the willingness to kill, I would suggest they consent to being killed by an exterior force, entity, human, whatever. 

To live by the sword is to die by the sword.

Other translations see this word kill to actually mean murder. So murder is the concept of killing because of hatred. An individual is in angst, agitated, dislikes another, and instead of making the attempt to resolve it, they choose this option. And I think this makes more sense to people in the idea if I am not willing to allow someone else to be human, why should I expect others to allow me to be human.

Here, I share Jesus's teaching from John 8:5-9 to express what I'm saying in a better capacity.

>5 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? 6 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. 7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. 8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. 9 And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. 
>**-John 8:5-9** from the Bible

Then we could get into some deeper subjects like war and stuff. 

What do you choose? 

To consent to war is to consent to war.

Then we have the seventh commandment, **(7)** Thou shalt not commit adultery. 

I get a lot of strife for this one from those in the religious field. 

This is a big one. And I wonder why that is, why sexuality is such a big deal. But in my conversations with experts and professionals in religion of church, they speak of how sex before marriage, and fornication, and all this other stuff is a form of sin.

I cannot 100% disagree with that, but I don't agree with the premise that the act of sex outside marriage is what this is talking about. However, I will hit on the topic of how promiscuity could very well be a symptom of sin in a bit. But first, let us stick with what is actually in the 10 commandments and this concept of adultery.

It is my understanding that adultery is merely the violation of a marriage contract/agreement. We could label this as cheating or infidelity at first glance. 

I think, to be more accurate, it is the violation of an agreement. An agreement is what we are doing, the expectations, etc. 

When one violates that agreement, it expresses in my eyes, implied consent within the Heart, to have one's agreements be violated as well. So in this, we see how this act of adultery is actually harming the one committing the adultery, not to say the other party will be/is not hurt.

But why would one feel the need to violate an agreement? 

That's what I'm suggesting is actually the sin. 

The need to feel that way. 

If two individuals decide to be swingers, and it's mutually agreed upon, are those individuals participating in adultery? 

I would think not.

Now, when we get into the concept of promiscuity and fornication and all that, which I don't believe is expressed in the 10 commandments, but it is talked about in other areas of the Bible. Does it hold merit or not?

I’m not sure. 

Does any of this hold merit? 

Decide for yourself.

In the idea of promiscuity, hook-up culture, and all that. I would suggest that this probably is, at least in most cases, a symptom of sin. 

The reason I say that is I ask the question, why does someone engage with another individual in that way outside of a relationship? 

I would suggest it is because they do not believe they are worthy to engage with someone in that way that they respect and actually want to be in a relationship with. Because of that, they resort to promiscuity. 

We can see this in extreme cases leading to sex addiction. I would define sex addiction to be when an individual participates in behavior that they are embarrassed about, aka, "Why did I hook up with that person?" and other behaviors. Often, the first signs of an addiction are shame and secrets, no matter what the addiction may be.

Again, from my perspective, sin is not an action. Sin is a false understanding that leads to actions that then create unnecessary suffering.

The seventh commandment goes as follows: **(8)** Thou shalt not steal. 

Now, this one is beyond interesting. It is my understanding that this translation is not accurate. What it actually was saying is Thou shalt not commit a trespass. 

Trespass is the violation of a boundary. So this would include stealing, but it's not just stealing.

Again, the idea of implied consent is within the Heart. If one consents to violating the boundaries of others, they consent to others violating their own boundaries. 

Then we can get into more deeper stuff about how if an individual cannot recognize the boundaries of others, cannot respect others, they will be unable to recognize the boundaries within themselves or even respect themselves.

We are focusing on this concept of Sin here, this innate and foundation of ignorance that runs our lives. It is not the action that we are concerned with here; it is the symptoms. A violation of the 10 commandments is merely a symptom of sin, not the sin itself.

The 9th commandment goes as follows, **(9)** Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour

Many suggest this has to do with lying and telling untruths. 

I would suggest that no one is capable of telling the truth because we don't know what it is. Then, to get more out there, into things like Reticular Activation Systems, Meta-Models, theories about the multiverse and how we are all living in our own universe and all that, it gets even more sketchy. 

None of us experience the same things in the same way, so what is the actual truth? What is actually taking place at any moment of time?

But from what I read, it does not say lie, it says bear false witness. What I would suggest this is is things like embezzling funds, getting on the stand and making a false accusation, and things of that nature. The activity of going out of one’s way to hurt someone through words or actions unjustly. And I could see how this actually ties into the tenth commandment.

Again, we're dealing with metaphysical stuff here and implied consent. If one is willing to bear false witness, to participate in that, I would conclude they consent to the same being done to them, which must happen because that is their agreement with this reality.

I would suggest that many forms of gossip, if not all gossip, is a violation of this 9th commandment. When we speak ill will of others behind their back, instead of confronting them, we consent to the same being done to us.

That tenth commandment being, **(10)** Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

Here, we conclude on what is specifically labeled as the 10 commandments. This idea of coveting. 

From my perspective, this is when an individual has ill will, envy, and jealousy towards what their neighbor has. Again, implied consent. If one has ill will and hatred towards their successful neighbor, they consent to having ill will and hatred directed toward themselves in their own success.

This can get a little out there, but in a lot of ways, this phenomenon will actually prevent one from being successful because who wants to be hated, especially to the point where they have to fear for their life, hire security guards, and all that? 

This unconscious motivation will actually self-sabotage an individual from reaching levels of success. 

To end, I want to make some comments about the last part of this chapter.

>18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off. 19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. 20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. 21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was. 22 And the Lord said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. 23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold. 24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee. 25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. 26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.

Let’s start with this…

>19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.  

Here we have the people speaking, “lest we die.”

We see the same wording in Genesis 3:3-5

>3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, **lest ye die.** 4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

This is talking about the fear of death. 

**Lest ye die...**

A lie, perhaps? 

And who said that?

>20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. 

A little bit more out there. I would suggest the presence of God is scary, it evokes fear. But the energy itself is a form of love and purification. However, in my experience, this Holy and Divine energy is hijacked by the sin. The sin then pollutes it into thoughts and imagination that make one afraid and do stupid things - symptoms of sin, but the dumb behaviors are not the sin itself.

>21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.

A lot of people are afraid of the dark, at least as children. 

The dark being that which is unknown. 

Why is that?

Maybe God lives and exists in the dark.

We are afraid of only that which we do not understand.

All emotions, I would suggest, including Shame, Guilt, Fear, Lust, Anger, and all the rest of it, are aspects of the Creator, Divine and Holy. It's the nature of [[Sin]], this foundation of false premises that then hijacks that energy and converts it to suffering and misery, internally or externally.

In the end, I think back on this passage of the teachings of Jesus...

>23 But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men. 24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. 25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. 
>**-Matthew 16:23-25** from the Bible

Pick up your cross and follow me is what is said. My interpretation of this is to walk the path, don't just read about it or intellectualize about it. It's in the process, the walk, in which the goal is achieved.

To finish this, I quote a maxim that I strongly believe in...

**He who does nothing, makes no mistakes; he who makes no mistakes, learns nothing.**

There is no success without overcoming and transcending failure.
