Selfishness

I think this word has become polluted over the years. Many who suggest that another is being selfish often say this as a manipulation technique. "You are not doing what I want you to do, therefore you are selfish." - this is backwards thinking.

Selfishness is the desire for others to do what they do not want to do. 

Selfishness has nothing to do with what one personally desires to do, it only becomes selfishness when one desires to make someone else do what they do not want to do.
