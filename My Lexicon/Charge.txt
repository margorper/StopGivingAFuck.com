Charge

A Charge is what many refer to as being triggered, an emotional response, or uncomfortable energy within the body. I hold to be true that this Charge is the result of a [[Clutch|Clutch]] within the astral body preventing, or merely restricting, the flow of the Electromagnetic Fluid that brings forth life and awareness into the corpse we currently inhabit.
