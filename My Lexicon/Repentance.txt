Repentance 

The concept of repentance is an idea that I sincerely believe to be misunderstood by the majority of those who live within and under the umbrella of [[Christianity]].

From my observations, as well as my personal experience when I was much, much, younger, it is believed that repentance has to do with feeling bad. Feeling guilty for example.

Often, this leads to the conclusion that one needs to apologize and ask for forgiveness. We can see this in some of the symbolism and art of those who declare themselves to be under the umbrella of Christianity, according to the mainstream interpretation of what it is.

Now, I hold that repentance is not about feeling guilty, or feeling bad, but the act of repentance is actually the transformation of the mind, and deeper still, the transformation and expansion of the Heart.

>17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. **-Matthew 4:17** from the Bible

In my eyes, it's talking about something in the here and now. Not something to be avoided or entered into in the future - that being this concept of going into hell or heaven based on a judgment from an external source.

>45 Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. **-John 5:45** from the Bible

I would go so far as to say that apologizing and saying sorry, which many appear to believe in my eyes to be the nature of repentance, is actually quite unproductive. I could even define this behavior to be evil, and a nature of [[Sin]] and nothing to do with repentance. This behavior of over apologizing and saying sorry all the time, I'd suggest, is the nature of [[Bleeding Out]] and to be avoided at all costs.

I would suggest that this would be different that legitimately making a mistake and creating a damage, and then making an effort to fix it, if possible. For example, rear ending someone's car because they were too busy staring at their phone.

In the end - **"He who does nothing, makes no mistakes; he who makes no mistakes, learns nothing."**

Repentance is not something we should avoid, but instead, we should welcome the opportunity to enter into repentance. 

It is simply the nature of moving up into and within understanding, and moving out of [[Sin]]. 

Without this phenomenon, we'd be stuck in the Garden of Eden, without thought or preference, a complete state of ignorance, and never knowing and lacking free will.

In my eyes, the process of Repentance can be achieved the long way, through life events, being that what we resist not only persists but grows. Or we can take the shortcut through the process of Harvesting - see [[Harvesting Meditation]].

To understand from my perspective the nature of guilt, what many believe repentance is, and I don't, the act of feeling and defining ones self as a wretch, I'd encourage checking out my piece [[Chart of Emotions]].
