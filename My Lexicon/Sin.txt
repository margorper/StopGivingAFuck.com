Sin 

Sin is an interesting topic and many ideas and concepts exist around its nature. I personally perceive the nature of Sin to be that of ignorance and to describe this, I use the following phrase, "The most pernicious of lies are the ones we tell ourselves, because we believe them."

Certain translations akin the idea of Sin to be that missing the mark, to being off target.

I would suggest it exists in the idea of not knowing the truth of this reality. Ignorance is bliss, at least for a while.

So to me, Sin is not an action within itself, but it is the foundation of ignorance that motivates one to enter into a state of suffering.

In the teachings of the Buddha, we can see this concept expressed as well, in the idea that suffering is from ignorance.

The problem is that we do not know what we do not know that we do not know. This gets into the concept of Plato's Cave.

I would speculate that this concept of Sin being inherited into what it means to be Human was actually a conscious choice at one point. We desired to step into ignorance. At first this gave us more meaning and expression to being outside of Sin. We found it entertaining.

However, through the course of time, that pressure and build-up have become stronger and stronger. The suffering has become more painful than the pleasure in which it provides.

In this, we go down and down and down, until hitting what could be perceived as rock bottom. Only then do we have the motivation to escape and rise back into truth, into the totality of what we are.

This can also be seen in my observations of the Hindu religion, Samsara, Karma, and all the rest of it.

Sin is the emotional investment in a Lie.
