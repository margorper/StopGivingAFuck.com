Reality Tunnel  

This is a concept that I obtained from Robert Anton Wilson's work in Prometheus Rising. He talks about this idea at the very beginning of the book, "What the thinker thinks, the prover proves". This gets into the idea of the reality tunnel.

There's a lot to this concept and to fully comprehend it, I think it must be experienced. Scientifically it can be easily witnessed an understood though the concepts of RAS - which stands for Reticular Activation System - and the Meta-Model which goes into how the mind works and interprets reality.

The basic premise is what we believe to be true, maybe what we simply want to believe to be true, we will find evidence to support that. It will just appear that reality is that way.

I know certain spiritual practices can be used to step into Reality Tunnels. For example, practicing Orthordox Christianity, can step into that one and have experiences and interpretations of reality that correspond to that school of thought. Same is true with Hinduism as well, can practice Yoga in it's different forms, and have experiences that correspond to that school of thought. Many others exists as well.

Quantum Physics and all that too go into this. Wave or Particle. The power of the observer.

Multiverse stuff.

Being Lucky or Unlucky.

All these concepts fit into this idea of the Reality Tunnel.
