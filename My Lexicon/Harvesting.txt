Harvesting 

Harvesting is the term I use to identify my form of meditation. It's the concept of consuming and digesting an emotional charge successfully through the presence of the [[Will]] and the absence of [[Spilling]].

I was first introduced to this concept by chance in the year of 2006 while experiencing intense anxiety at a Walmart for no apparent reason. You can learn more about it from this article, [[Harvesting Meditation]]

Later on, after practicing and learning other schools of thought, I would come back to this practice and perfect it.

Harvesting was the name that was given to me during this practice around the year of 2020 and its meaning and my understanding of what it is, and what it is for, continues to evolve to this day.
