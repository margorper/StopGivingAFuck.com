Bleeding Out

Bleeding Out is a term I refer to when a personality has holes in the ego, bad boundaries. 

This can be seen internally by that rationalizing and justifying of one's thoughts, emotions and/or actions. Also, it can be seen when one sacrifices their own well-being for another because they feel guilty about someone outside of themselves feeling unhappy, unloved, uncomfortable, etc. - being overly responsible for others. Some might see this as being super  empathic.

Bleeding Out results in massive frustration and severe depression.
