Spilling  

Spilling is the result of the mind's attempt to rationalize and justify discomfort. It comes up with reasoning and trying to find the cause. Often this is built and stemming from a false precedent, or false conclusion that has been set previous. We could call these assumptions and presumptions. Not necessarily true, often never, but simply conclusions we made in the past based on false logic or inaccurate information.

Spilling evokes the internal dialogue and the imagination. 

In high stressed situations, these thoughts and images can be daunting. My experience, the only way to transcend this is through a successful [[Harvesting Meditation|Harvest]]

Also, people do this in their conversations and arguments. The spilling comes out in the form of speech/dialogue/statements/claims, often in the attempt to explain themselves during times of discomfort caused by fear or attachment.
