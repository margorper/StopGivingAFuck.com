Self-Image 

The self-image is an interesting concept. Many works have come into existence on this topic. One that comes immediately to mind is Cybernetics. A lot of material on NLP exists as well.

I have a slightly different spin on this concept.

The Self-Image is an abstract concept held within the individual. This construct holds within it certain definitions of who this individual is - we could see this also in terms of the ego, the identity. 

However, where I differentiate from many other authors and thought leaders on this topic, I would suggest the self-image not only includes the terms and definitions of how the individual defines themselves but also includes the terms and definitions they hold of others existing in the external reality.

This also plays a part in Shadow Work from the works of Carl Jung.

The labels and limitations we place on others is how we will perceive, understand, and comprehend others.

To understand this even more, I'd suggest looking into the Reticular Activation System and the Meta-Model which was created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder. Can learn more about their work from the book [[Structures of Magic by Richard Bandler and John Grinder]].

I think back on the teachings of Jesus from the Bible.

>13 When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?” 14 They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” 15 “But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?” 16 Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” 17 Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. 18 And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. 19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” 20 Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. 
>**-Matthew 16:13-20** from the Bible

Even more interesting is the scene when Jesus is in front of Pontius Pilate. There are many ways to interpret what is going on here, but for now, I think it's useful to see his response, "You have said so." - he's not placing any limitations on anyone else, outside of himself. He's allowing people to use their own minds to define who he is.

>3 So Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?” “**You have said so,**” Jesus replied. 4 Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.” 
>**-Luke 23:3-4** from the Bible

The Self-Image is a very interesting concept and something that I would suggest is infinitely explored, developed, and redefined during our progression.
