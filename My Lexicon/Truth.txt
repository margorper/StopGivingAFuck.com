Truth  

I think often we are very confused about what Truth is. 

We tell ourselves, this is true and this is not true, thinking that is Truth.

I often describe Truth as merely the absence of a lie, that which is without lies, without [[Sin]].

To go further, I would suggest that Truth is a person, a very real person. 

It is a living being and, like all beings, it has a sexuality.

I would suggest that, like any person, we cannot fully know who or what a person truly is.

However, we can have a relationship with a person.

Through that relationship, we grow and expand. We discover more about ourselves.
