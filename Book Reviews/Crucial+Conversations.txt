Crucial Conversations 


“Crucial Conversations” by Joseph Grenny, Kerry Patterson, Ron McMillan, Al Switzler, and Emily Gregory is a book on how to be assertive in communication and how to handle interactions that will or will be likely to evoke a high level of stress and emotion.

This book operates in a framework format, giving the reader a map of how to engage in interactions that may raise high levels of emotion.

The emphasis on having a strong intention by asking one’s self…

“What do I want to achieve in this interaction?”

And

“What do I want to avoid in this interaction?”

By listing those out the individual will have a stronger frame of communication and is less likely to dip or fall into trivial nonsensical communication that serves no purpose.

The other thing they go into is basic models of communication and the necessity for mutual trust and mutual purpose.

Mutual trust is the ability to engage in dialogue and add to the meaning pool - a term they use in this book. If trust is broken, one or both individuals are likely to operate from silence or violence. 

This will be witnessed by withdrawal from the communication, the desire to create meaning, or in reference to violence, the motivation to be defensive or aggressive. In these states of consciousness, it is impossible to exchange dialogue and add to the meaning pool.

They provide techniques on how to bring back mutual trust if it is not present or is sliding in a less-than-productive direction.

Mutual purpose is an understanding and strong intention to be mutually beneficial towards each other. Think of being on the same team.

Mutual purpose is basically the concept of looking out for one another and desiring to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome for all parties. This may result in a compromise, but with mutual purpose everyone is allowed to get on the same page, moving in the same direction, toward a now perceived same goal.

Worth the read.
