Structures of Magic by Richard Bandler and John Grinder


This is a book, I don't really know if it's the best title. It's a book about the nature of language and this thing called the meta-model. The basic premise is that we cannot perceive all of reality. Our minds instead delete, distort and generalize data to be processed based on our own preconceived filters of said reality.

There's a lot of depths, almost mystery, to this concept. The idea of what does it really mean? What does anything really mean?

From my understanding, this is a book written probably for therapist or counselors who are tasked with evoking change and transformation to their clients. 

I kind of criticize the title, though I personally like it and it makes total sense to me. But I don't think the majority of the population, more especially in academia with their PHD's, would be open to the idea of entertaining a book with the word Magic in it to be of service to them.

Though, I would suggest that the schools of magic are actually much more effective and modern day psychology is the copy of a copy of a copy of ideas and concepts created ages ago. Yet modern culture and society is what it is, and certain words, carry weight and taboo and evoke the ick to those that are too smart for their own good.

Needless to say all that, this is a very impactful and quite powerful piece of work. It'll definitely change your reality for the better and have a more practical and useful map for comprehending the nature of others.
