Meditations by Marcus Aurelius

I first read this book around the age of 30 and found it quite interesting. Many of my ideas, which I cultivated on my own in my early 20s and onward, I came to find had already been invented many, many years ago.

As the phrase goes, "There is nothing new under the sun."

This work is probably the most notorious work in the area of Stoicism, which is a form of philosophy that encourages a life of virtue and to refrain from attempting to control anything that is outside of one's control.

Also, a big argument in this philosophy has to do with the temporary nature of existence, this concept being in the idea that "This too shall pass". 

Everything is temporary, good and bad. 

Everything is temporary, favor and disfavor. 

Everything is temporary, pleasant and unpleasant.

All this too shall pass through the hands of time.

Everything of seeming importance and significant eventually will be completely forgotten.

This is the nature of existence, at least "this" existence - that nature being one of constant change, transmutation, transformation, conversion, and on and on.

This is my understanding of the Stoics constant pursuit of Virtue - the idea that only that of Virtue could be carried into the next existence. Nothing material will come with us for that is all to return to dust.

What I found most interesting about this text is that Marcus's intention for this work is to be a very personal and private work. He had no intention of publishing it. He had no intention of sharing his wisdom with others. It was for him and him alone. 

He, however, did die, and it is my understanding that his family saw relevance to his ideas and concepts, and they are the ones who desired to share them.

Many believe Marcus Aurelius was the inventor of Stoicism and credit him for this work - this is not the case. He was merely a student of philosophy and worked to live in accordance with it. Many had come before him; he was not the inventor, though he is perhaps the most praised for this mode of thinking.

Many teachings, support groups, ideas and concepts in today's modern society stem from that of Stoicism. Many find benefit from Marcus Aurelius's work being titled "Meditations".

Personally, I found it quite interesting and relatable. A good reminder into perceiving what is actually important - overall, definitely worth the read.
