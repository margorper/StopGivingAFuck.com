The Rules of Double-Entry Bookkeeping by Luca Pacioli

I read this book around 2014. I was studying banking and many subjects related to commerce and the merchant class. It's written by a monk who worked for the queen in the 1400's. There's a lot of hidden gems in this book about the nature of humanity and what not. I found that valuable because I began to see how some of the same "problems" that I complained about, had existed even back then.

Overall, I found this book also valuable for just a general understanding of academic accounting. I know I had taken accounting in college and really struggled to comprehend it, though I did very well in finance. Why's that, not sure.

But this book, very concise and short does an excellent job of really explaining the fundamentals of the system.

It is my understanding that the author was the original inventor of the system that we all now use yet know not who invented it or where it came from. Instead we push these 500+ page text books, on something that can be read in a few hours.

Though on the concept of accounting and double-entry booking, there are many other aspects of this book that can be perceived. 

Though, existing sometimes between the lines.
