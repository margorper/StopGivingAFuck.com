When I Say No, I Feel Guilty by Manuel J. Smith

When I Say No, I Feel Guilty by Manuel J. Smith is an excellent book on assertiveness and developing the tools to not be manipulated by guilt and shame and other nefarious but often unconscious communication techniques from others.

The book is filled with dialogues between people in all sorts of different aspects of life. From working with authority, family, friends, and coworkers - within the scope of this book, there are examples of the most common frustrating scenarios people may find themselves in.

It has a handful of specific strategies for handling manipulative people and not losing one’s self-respect during conversations that may appear tough or difficult to deal with.

I’d suggest this book is definitely worth reading and that many of those who are led to my website, stopgivingafuck.com, will find the tools and strategies provided in this work to be most beneficial.
