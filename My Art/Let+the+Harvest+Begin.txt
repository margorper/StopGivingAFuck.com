I used AI for the actual music, but wrote the lyrics myself when I was in an alternate state of consciousness. I guess you could call it channeling, something I find satisfaction from and something I enjoy engaging in when it comes to producing art.

It's an interesting work and it's up to interpretation on what is being said and why. I think a good question to ask is who exactly is singing in this specific track and to whom?

A lot of different concepts and ideas within this work. Again, this is a piece of art and is meant to be an expression.

If interested, you can find this on all the major platforms including, but not limited, to Spotify and Apple Music.
