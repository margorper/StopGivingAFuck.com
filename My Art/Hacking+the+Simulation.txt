Hacking the Simulation

Hacking the Simulation is a book of poems I wrote during early 2024 and released that spring. It's only available on Kindle. It's a piece of art, first and foremost, but within it are many concepts and ideas.

If you are interested in my book, hop on Amazon and search for "Hacking the Simulation: A Book on Mind over Matter" and you'll find it.
