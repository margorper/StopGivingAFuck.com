Harvesting Meditation 

Harvesting is the term I have come up with for the mediation I primarily practice. The name simply came to me while practicing it.

I originally became initiated in the beginning of this practice around 2006. I was at a Walmart and this extreme level of anxiety came over me. I wasn’t near anyone, just simply in the store in the clothing department.

For whatever reason, I became curious as to why this feeling came over me. I had absolutely no rational reason to feel this way. Bewildered, I just kind of observed the phenomenon like a scientist.

Making no judgement, not attempting to come up with a why (rationalize or justify) I was experiencing this sensation. I just simply observed.

Very quickly, I saw the sensation dissolve. I then saw the imagery in my mind’s eye of this being akin to turning on a flashlight. The anxiety was the battery and the flashlight was me simply observing it, without judgement. By turning on the flashlight, I could use up the battery (anxiety) which would eventually drain and run out of energy. The anxiety for that specific scenario was now gone.

I learned to practice this but it was kind of random. It didn’t happen consciously or as a practice. I just knew it was an option when I found myself feeling anxious.

Later in life, maybe 2007 or 2008, I'd be introduced to different forms of meditation. I'd go on to read a lot of books and practice under various teachers. This allowed me to learn a lot on theory and mechanics, some of which I still strongly agree with.

The biggest thing I got from the teachers and books I studied under was the development of a practice, being habitual. I learned the importance of continuous improvement and to constantly be seeking more and more development in whatever practice or school of thought I was under at the time.

In this, I would take on many different forms of meditation and learn to step into those reality tunnels and have experiences that corresponded with those schools of thought. 

However, I now focus on my practice of Harvesting and sincerely believe it to be superior and a better path for me and many others. 

This might not be true for everyone. I’d be skeptical to say that it is because everyone is different and we all have different paths. But I’ve found it to be the most impactful practice, and with it, I have seen my growth and development towards my personal goals and objectives rapidly move in a positive direction at an exponential speed compared to my practice in other schools of thought.

That said, [[Harvesting]] is more difficult to implement than other forms of meditation. It requires a higher level of focus and awareness, a stronger implementation of the [[Will]]. 

As one develops into Harvesting more, the focus and awareness, Will, necessary for a successful Harvest must become stronger and greater.

To understand Harvesting, we must first understand the nature of what I call a [[Charge]].

A Charge is the accumulation of emotional energy. I hold this to be an electromagnetic fluid that is trapped or restricted within the astral body. 

The way I attempt to explain this is to think of a garden hose hooked up to a faucet with the water turned on max. If we were to pick up the hose and squeeze it very tightly we will sense a vibration and more often a noise. This squeezing of the hose, is in essence, the same within our astral body during a [[Clutch]].

Within the astral body, where this electromagnetic fluid flows, we have a tendency to clutch internally. To develop the capacity to witness this phenomenon of the fluid, for me took quite some time. So if this isn’t true for you or you cannot perceive it, that’s ok and it is not necessary to agree with me on this point for this practice to work. 

We are all built differently, and what is true for me, may or may not be true for you. Use your own experience to be the judge. I’d never want anyone to blindly believe in the words I say. Instead, search and discover what is true for yourself.

Now, we understand the nature of a clutch. 

What does the clutch do? 

The clutch is actually the generator for the internal dialogue and imagination. This squeezing that creates the vibration in the metaphorical garden hose then creates the vibration, the energy, which then spins off the noise. 

That noise is the internal dialogue and the imagination, what I call [[Spilling]].

Many say that thoughts create emotion, in that order. I can’t completely disagree with this, but I’d say it’s thoughts that are hidden that create the clutch which then the clutch creates the conscious thoughts, the internal dialogue, what we perceive as thoughts and imagination.

So, to initiate a successful Harvest, what we want to do is become aware and focus in on the sensation of discomfort. So we willfully and voluntarily go into the pain, into the discomfort.

The thing we must be cautious of is what I call [[Spilling]]. 

Spilling is the phenomenon whereby the internal dialogue and imagination are initiated and provoked. If we get seduced by this noise, the Harvest is going to be unsuccessful. 

Only in the absence of noise can we Harvest successfully.

When I am coaching individuals live in this practice, we go through, and I primarily remain silent. However, every 30-300 seconds, I’ll speak the question, “Where is it?”, they respond on the location. I then respond with, “Perfect.” And then I’ll repeat this every 30-300 seconds until the Harvest is successful. I kind of just have a 6th sense if they are spilling within themselves, and make the attempt to wake them back up.

Another thing that is common with beginners is passing out, that is falling asleep. I could go into this more but will choose not to in this article. The important thing is to just be aware of the phenomenon. The Mind will come in and cause a deep drowsiness, and the Individual can fall asleep and lose out on their chance for the Harvest, or at least miss the spot for the time being.

As one advances, this can still happen, but the pass out will be very brief, less than a second. This still happens to me, but I don’t react by completely going to sleep. I simply am aware that it happened and go directly back in, still having access. Again, it will be less than a second.

For beginners, when this takes place, they often lose memory of the charge or where they were in the Harvest. This is disappointing, but there will always be another time. It'll still be there, just again hidden for now.

Now the goal is to perceive the exact location in the kink in the metaphorical hose. This will be located somewhere in the body. Usually the torso, but not always. I’ve come to witness that often it will be in alignment with the center of the body, other times associated with one of the organs. 

Everyone is different, though. Some I have worked with report it is primarily in their back or neck.

Starting out for beginners, more than likely, but still can be present even after many sessions, instead of a single point within the body, agitation will seem to be present within the whole body. The whole body appears to be inflamed or agitated.

Just this sensation of agitation throughout and ever present. "I am agitated."

When this is the case, we simply sit in the agitation and be fully aware of this phenomenon, while still declining to be seduced into [[Spilling]]. I refer to this stage as Sitting in the Muck. After a period of time, it will move to a specific location within the body and the focus and awareness is then transferred to that point.

**Pro Tip:** During this process, relax the eyebrows, the tip of the nose, and the top of the scalp/head. Often, there will exists, an unconscious tension in these areas, which is also a form of a clutch.

For theory and basic models of understanding, these are a few of the ones I use to explain what is going on.

First model is the idea of the pipeline towards what I call bandwidth. By inserting the will into the location of the clutch we are expanding the garden hose, the pipeline, to then allow more bandwidth to flow through. The bandwidth now increased then allows more access to what I would call the Grand Mind. Carl Jung would probably call this the collective unconscious.

Second model is the idea that by focusing our will, the will being a masculine force, we then insert this will into the emotion itself, the emotion being a feminine force. The way I imagine this is going through a long tunnel and impregnating the emotion, which then births something new. New idea, new perspective, paradigm, or world view.

The other model I have used is during this process, I imagine I am in a silent and dark void, infinite abyss. In this abyss, there is only me, my consciousness, and this present sensation. I then take on the understanding that this sensation is an aspect of me. I then consider the idea that I can choose to accept myself or I can choose to reject myself. Which path shall I go? 

I always choose acceptance. 

By choosing to accept myself, I now initiate the integration process by simply being with the sensation and accepting the sensation as an aspect of me until fully integrated, which occurs when I successfully stop fighting and pushing it away.

Now, what is all this about, and why is it occurring? This would take a great work to go into within every nook and cranny on my views on this process and phenomenon.

Basically, we have worldviews. A map of reality. Paradigms.

Maps of reality do not match the territory, they are simply a map to get from point A to point B. Think of a road map. It doesn't show everything, only the things necessary to get you to where you want to go. It's simplified instructions that can be digested easily to achieve your current goal.

These maps are often, if not always, flawed in some way, lacking perfection. I’d suggest always to some degree, but some maps are better than others.

These maps are built off assumptions and presumptions. These are what we call Beliefs. The source of angst or suffering is the byproduct of an ineffective map, brought about by a belief or beliefs that no longer serve us in our present stage of development.

These beliefs, limiting us, are held together by conclusions we hold or have made by an emotional charge.

For example, we are asked to do something we don’t want to do and are then forced to do it through coercion. We then establish the Belief, “Ask the ones you hate, not the ones you love.” tied to the emotion of anger or apathy.

From here on, anytime someone ask us for something, we assume and presume they hate us. We then react negatively, perhaps experience anxiety or an adrenaline spike when asked to do something.

These assumptions and presumptions ultimately form the identity, what I hold to believe Jesus is alluding to in this parable of the House and the Storm. House is the identity; storm is heavy emotion.

>24 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: 25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. 26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: 27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.
>
>**Matthew 7:24-27** from the Bible

This goes across the board, from lack of self-respect, lack of faith, lack of self-esteem, aggressive or passive behavior, and any other problem one is currently facing.

Ultimately, in my exploration, these presumptions and assumptions form a hierarchy; maybe you could see it as a pyramid. You have foundational Beliefs, these basic conclusions we hold to be true. The layers of presumptions and assumptions build off those foundational beliefs, often in the form of a chain. The higher up the chain you go, towards the foundation, the more hidden they are. We completely ignore them. This is our fundamental foundation of ignorance. We are ignorant that we are ignorant. We don't know that we don't even know. 

This is the path to understanding.

When we hit a point in life where these assumptions and presumptions no longer add up. When we realize the map we hold is flawed. When we realize that our paradigm is polluted. When we realize our world view simply no longer works or no longer serves a positive and agreeable purpose. 

This then can, and often, evokes massive amounts of unhappiness and stress.

When this happens, if prolonged and unresolved, what takes place is an existential crisis. The falling away from the old identity; the crumbling of the House. This can be emotionally upsetting and dismal. Think divorce, loss of a job, and all sorts of stuff that can cause people to feel very bad and sometimes do very stupid things.

If survived, a new house is built on the new foundation, and a new identity has been formed. This can result in something as simple as a new haircut, which is very common and can be witnessed. If someone changes their haircut, almost guarantee that their worldview has been recently updated.

The crumbling of the house can be quite dramatic if one is not strong enough in their power of the Will. They hit the negative construct, this triggers the spilling, and then more lies and falsehoods are built on the unresolved conflict based on an illegitimate conclusion, a foundation of sand. This is why [[Spilling]] is very unproductive and can be dangerous. 

When we spill, often we are building new beliefs on an inadequate foundation, resulting in more garbage.

In my experience, the only way out is through. On the other side of the discomfort is a higher form of truth. Something of more substance for the identity to then stand upon until the next level is to be reached.

That said, if not done correctly and spilling commences and it’s not put in check, the results can possibly be less than favorable. More especially at the higher levels of the game, as the pipeline is more open, which results in emotions/charges of much greater intensity. That means greater sensations of discomfort.

My last point on this.

I primarily do this exercise in a recliner with an eye mask on and ear muffs. Blocking out light and sound to limit distractions and intensify access to the charge.

However, my other method is to sit in a standard chair, think kitchen table chair. Thighs parallel to the floor. Tuck feet under chair, if chair is too short. Sitting forward so my back does not touch the back of the chair. I then sit erect, my head as high as it can go. Keeping the spine completely strong and erect.

I then practice the same concept. However, instead of the emotions/charge, I focus the Will into the tightness and discomfort within the spine and muscles of the back and neck. The physical pain versus the emotional pain.

I find this technique useful for more extreme situations where the Spilling has gotten out of control. We could call this phenomenon “racing thoughts,” which can result in issues with not being able to sleep or nonsensical thoughts and irrational behaviors.

Basic practice: eye mask and ear muffs, set a timer for no more than 30 minutes. Could be as little as 5. Do the drill and sit, spine erect, and acknowledge and be one with the pain and discomfort. 

This can be very uncomfortable, waiting on the timer to ring makes it even more so which is why it is used. This discomfort and physical pain seem to bring one into a more grounded state, calmer, less spilling.

I find this will eliminate, or at least greatly reduce, the Spilling and racing thoughts for that specific Harvesting attempt.

Last note: 

I am not a doctor, a psychologist, a psychiatrist, or anything like that, and I am not here to give medical advice, nor am I attempting to do so.

I am merely sharing my personal experience and what works for me. Use your own judgment and take personal responsibility for what you choose to participate in and what you choose to do with your life and the consequences, good or bad, that come from those choices.

If you find yourself troubled, do not completely discount the idea of seeking professional medical attention and/or services. Do what you think is best for you and live with the consequences.

That’s on you, not me.
