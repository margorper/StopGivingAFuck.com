Harvesting (Advanced)

**Note**: I’m not a doctor, psychiatrist, psychologist, or anything like that. This is merely my understanding and my nonprofessional perspective. If you find yourself troubled, do not completely discount the idea of seeking professional medical advice or services.

**Read with intense discretion and personal discernment.**

This piece assumes you have read and practiced [[Harvesting Meditation]] and at least become a witness to its effects.

I cannot suggest that this method or practice will work for every single individual in existence. That I do not know and cannot prove. I’ve witnessed its effects only in myself and a very small number of people who were willing to actually put it to the test.

Most people in my experience are unwilling or incapable of implementing it. I suspect because it is quite uncomfortable and many wish to avoid anything that makes them uncomfortable.

My other speculation is that many wish to hold onto the lies and illusions of this world and have not the desire for Truth.

In this, for those who have the desire, and wish to experiment with this method to determine through their own personal experience its validity, I offer some further insights.

What we are partaking in is the consumption of “the bread”, what I often refer to as a [[Charge]] for better communication of what it is.

The participation in this discipline is to consume and digest the bread to enter into wholeness.

>And he took **bread**, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. **-Luke 22:19**  from the Bible
  
“Do this in remembrance of me.”

Remembrance of who?

“I am the Way, the Truth, and the Light.”

I think back on Genesis 3:19

>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat **bread**, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. Genesis 3:19 -  from the Bible

So it is in the voluntary and willingness to consume the bread that we may enter into higher and higher levels of truth. I think to be more accurate, to pierce through deeper and deeper layers of the lies that bind and enslave us.

I would suggest the most productive thing we can do in this reality is to consume this “bread”. Many distractions abound, many todos, many temptations, but all of this is but an illusion, more lies to keep us enslaved.

Many wonder what it is that they need to do. Many wonder what it is they should believe. Many are attempting to figure it all out. Many wish to be experts before they take the first step on the path.

But this will never be. We are incapable in our ignorance of knowing such things. It is only through the bread of life may we come into understanding, we simply cannot do this on our own, for our eyes are blind, our ears are deaf.

When it comes to these trivial distractions, let the dead bury their dead.

In this, I’d offer some insights for those who are serious about this practice.

One thing to keep in mind is I would suggest it is very important to transcend crying. Whether that is from grief, realizing an attachment is or will soon be gone. Or perhaps even anger, the understanding that expectations do not meet up with reality.

I say the word transcend with the utmost importance. I do not use the were refrain. I do not suggest one should prevent themselves from entering into these states of emotion and then to consciously shove them down by refraining. 

Instead, transcend it. Allow the emotions to flow up and out. This can primarily be accomplished by avoiding the [[Clutch]]. More specifically, relax the top of the scalp, the eyebrows, and the tip of the nose when the energy begins to rise up.

It’s my understanding the clutch is a desire to hold onto the lie. That’s what it is and it will evoke internal dialogue, thoughts and imagination that prevent the truth from coming in to pierce through the lies of this reality/experience.

>Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. **-Psalms 46:10** from the Bible

At higher levels of the practice, when the emotions are very intense and the flow is quite significant. If one is to attempt to refrain from experiencing whatever it is, crying, intense fear, grief, anger, or whatever, by tightening the clutch, for example, trying to prevent crying through effort, instead of transcending it all by relaxing the clutch, it can occur into the event that I would refer to as the bounce.

Even more so is when you tap into higher levels of Truth and Beauty - this can bring about intense emotions of joy and happiness and all that. That kind of Beauty that can create the desire to tear up, cry, and all that.

But, as of my current understanding, transcend crying. 

Allow it to flow, don't cry it out, and in my experience, that Truth and Beauty will then begin to collect into Your Heart. This will then show you incrementally as things unfold on who it is that you are.

Basically, if there is no [[Clutch]] this process will occur automatically. It's about not tensing up when the tears of joy come up, which will cause the tears to flow. Sometimes I find I have to stretch my arms out horizontally and raise my chest to allow the current to flow without restriction.

The bigger the charge, the bigger the gain.

The energy flows up, but due to the clutch, it cannot move forward and out. The energy hits, then bounces from above, and then shoots down rapidly. Usually, this results in a ping-pong effect. The energy rises, hits, falls, hits again, and rises back up. On and on. Up, down, up, down, and not good. Faster and faster.

I would suggest the exterior reality would refer to this as rapid cycling. Where the individual moves from crying due to grief or anger or whatever, to extreme laughter, then back again. Cycling through it all.

Again, from my perspective this is a symptom of the desire to hang on, to hold onto a lie.

Why is it so emotionally involved? To acknowledge the truth, we have to acknowledge the past inside of the lie. Many of us have been involved with many things, made many decisions, and made many attachments based on these lies.

I would suggest to fully understand this, it needs to be experienced. Language will not cut it.

Back and forth, back and forth. Up and down, up and down.

There are a few significant problems with this. The main problem is that a lie is being held on to, as opposed to piecing through it by way of truth. 

Another problem is the energy is so intense it’s going to fuel this lie at a much more profound way than it had currently been running in the background of the unconscious, it’s now exposed, it is now raw, it is now being fueled with great intensity, and the energy is being thrown into it. 

Much like a blower sending air into a fire.

This can have many effects, none of which are pleasant. 

The last significant issue with this is that it can cause problems, for example, being hospitalized and diagnosed with a mental disorder, which is an example of an unpleasant experience.

However, “He who does nothing, makes no mistakes: he who makes no mistakes, learns nothing.”

>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. **-Romans 8:28** from the Bible

There’s much more I could say about the variety of lies presented but I strongly believe that language will never do it justice. It must be witnessed and passed through. Through the crux, if you will. “Pick up your cross and follow me.”

But in this, I would suggest that it is possible to begin to understand many things. Including, even what the Buddha went through under his tree.

At the same time, we are all unique individuals with our own history, I would suggest many lifetimes worth, and stepping into that is a unique and individual process. To share my experiences, my perspectives, I strongly believe would not be productive in any way, more likely it would only create a damage.

That said, I share what I believe may be useful for those on the pursuit and find this particular method/practice/discipline to be valid and fruitful.

**Again, think for yourself. Take responsibility for your own life. I do not encourage blind faith, nor do I encourage blindly following advice of any kind, from anyone.**

**Update - 2025-05-08**

I’ve been motivated to add some more to this specific piece. Personally, I’m cautious about going into too many details about my own experience, specifically because I do not wish to place any limitations out there. 

What I mean by this is expectations or preconceived conclusions about how things are supposed to be or supposed to go. I would speculate that this journey is an individual process, and that process is going to be unique. So my experiences would actually place a wall or barrier to this self-discovery.

It is my experience and my conclusion that the internal dialogue, thoughts within themselves, are actually the symptom or the byproduct of a clutch. This goes very much against mainstream science, which suggests that thoughts evoke an emotion, while I am suggesting the desire to hold on to or avoid an emotion is actually what cultivates the thoughts.

Many people in meditation circles desire to have a silent mind and speak of this as a goal, to rid the mind of the mind chatter. To silence the dancing monkeys inside of the mind.

If you are committed to Harvesting, I think you will find that this is indeed easy to accomplish, at least temporarily. Meaning 5 minutes, an hour, etc. In totality, I would suggest not.

Why?

Because new experiences are always coming in, we latch on to those experiences. We overcome a limitation and we step into a new desire.

This process is a daily thing.

“Give us this day our Daily Bread”

The struggle, the obstacle, the problem has to do with lies and the discomfort required to penetrate those lies. Personally, I would suggest this discomfort to be emotional energy that has accumulated, been piled and piled within for many lifetimes. The intensity of this can be quite extreme.

Also, we are dealing with lies that are quite seductive. I would almost suggest they are, by nature, that of coercion. It is the essence of that which binds us, enslaves us, and manipulates us. This is the nature of sin. This can be both positive and negative. But in essence, I would suggest it is all “bad”, even that which may feel enticing or good.

In this process, we can learn to silence the mind, or seemingly so. In my experience, in this place, the internal chatter, thoughts, and all that will go very quiet and seemingly disappear. But that is not 100% true.

What I have found is there exists a frequency that is very high pitched, it cannot be heard if internal dialogue is present, if thoughts are covering it up. This gets into the nature of the clutch and what I’ve come to see all this mess is about. We do not want to face this stuff, so we have buried it. We have found ways to distract ourselves from looking at it.

This high-pitched frequency in my experience, just my personal experience, appears to be coming from above at like a 45 degree angle, left and right. When I step into it this begins to unravel a lot of tension and emotions within the body itself. They say that the body keeps score. Trauma gets trapped in the body. I would say this is true.

So in that process, a lot of sensations can come into awareness.

As this process unfolds, it's like these recordings get played. There is this high-pitched frequency, but out of that will come recordings, sound bites. 

This process is not forced. Instead, it’s like they float up out of this phenomenon. It’s simply sitting in peace and patience, do they appear and can then be dealt with, eradicated, and moved beyond.

Dialogue of previous experiences. Some of these will be recognizable, some will seem very real but may not be recognizable from this lifetime. Some of these can almost be supernatural in a way. All of the above will usually evoke negative emotions. In some cases, extreme levels of fear.

One observation, it appears that when the fear, grief, anger, or whatever it is is passed through by way of truth, that dialogue is no longer relevant. This could get into ideas of limiting beliefs, statements, or definitions of limitation. When the lie is no longer being invested in, the lie itself dissolves. Often to be forgotten.

The same thing can take place with tonality itself - the sound can generate an emotion. And when that emotion is pierced through by way of the truth, that sound, that tonality, no longer has an influence. Like a bad song stuck in the head, finally removed.

And it is only through passing through the fear that we can dissolve the lies. Some of these lies are very tricky and seductive so they can be difficult to pass through, because we may literally not wish to give them up.

This is the battle.

>24 “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. 26 And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. 27 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.” **-Matthew 7:24-27** from the Bible
