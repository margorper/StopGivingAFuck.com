What Else Could It Mean

This is an exercise I came up with back in 2006.

What else could it mean?

So you list out whatever it is, primarily, I did things that I found frustrating.

You write that out on a piece of paper, the circumstances.

You then ask, "What does this mean?"

You answer that question and write it down on the paper...

Next, you ask, "What else could it mean?"

You then write that out on the paper below.

After that, you keep repeating, "What else could it mean?" and continue to write and write.

I'd say to make the goal to come up with 20 answers to this question.

Usually, in my experience, creativity and individualized expression do not even begin until after the 5th answer is written down. The first 5 are often just regurgitations, the [[Spilling]] and vomit, that we have heard from tv and other personalities.

This is a form of meditation called "Self-Inquiry". I came up with it on my own, however, many other Yogis have discovered and shared the same in their own way and method.

Try to hit 20 before you stop. It may be difficult, but you can do it if you allow it to come out. It doesn't have to be correct or right.Â 

The first thought that comes in as you answer the question, even if it sounds completely ridiculous, is very much worth consideration and contemplation. I'd encourage to write out the "first" thought, and then move to the next, and the next... 

Each being the first thought to reveal itself. 

The first thought, it is the most valuable, even when it doesn't make sense.
