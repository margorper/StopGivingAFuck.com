Ending Relationships

I think this is a major sticking point for many of my readers. We find ourselves in relationships that are of no service, yet we wish not to end them because we anticipate feeling guilty for hurting another individual's feelings. In this, we sacrifice our own well-being for another, and that other being useless to our cause.

First, I'd like to point out that this stance, people pleasing, fear of upsetting or making another outside ourselves feel bad, unloved, or whatever is a great tool by the forces that manipulate us. 

We cannot be free if we are manipulated by guilt. 

And we cannot fulfill our destiny if we are manipulated by any way or method.

If you have and know your [[Higher Purpose]], and you can see that a relationship is not in alignment with that higher purpose, staying in that relationship will result in [[Bleeding Out|bleeding out]] the love given by whatever it is that pours into us. 

We're literally [[Bleeding Out|bleeding out]] our life force when we participate in this. 

This results in low self-esteem, a lack of self-respect, low energy/apathy to do and accomplish the things necessary for our progression and evolution.

If you are not certain, maybe stay in it, and wait until you do know. But if you are certain, why not just end it.

This process does not need to be mean, or aggressive, or whiny, or complaining, or weak, or anything like that. It doesn't have to be difficult, it really doesn't. 

If you are on the fence or can't decide, I highly recommend my meditation. 

[[Harvesting Meditation]]

This meditation is beyond powerful and it will provide clarity and guidance if you are successful in harvesting the [[Charge]].

When the ending of this relationship that is of no use is achieved, the other side will then provide more self-esteem, more creative potential, more energy, and higher spirits. 

You must respect yourself and your cause - no one is going to do this for you. If someone is getting in the way, boot them out.

As a template and to give a basic idea of a straightforward and easy way to end a relationship, I provide the following.

> I think our relationship has evolved and I don't feel this friendship is working out for me anymore. No ill will or resentments here, just need to prioritize my own well-being.
> 
> Appreciate the times we shared. Definitely helped me on my path growing up and developing. Hope the same is true for you. Need to move forward, and that includes stepping away from this friendship. 
> 
> Wish you well.
