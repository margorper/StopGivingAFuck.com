The Most Significant Relationship

The most important relationship that can be obtained is the relationship with The Christ, which is formed through Our common Love for Truth.

That relationship has to be more important than anything else, including our own emotions, such as sadness, grief, fear, and all the rest of it.

In speaking forth Our Truth, we may encounter many mixed emotions, a necessary element for our development.

The Bigger the Charge, the Bigger the Gain.

Through that, we collect the charge, harvest the energy, and consume and digest our “Daily Bread”.

In this We discover who it is We really are.
