Speak Forth Your Truth

**He who does nothing, makes no mistakes; he who makes no mistakes, LEARNS NOTHING!!!**

It is beyond significantly important if You are going to step up and be a Player in this game that You bring forth Your truth, whatever that is at "This" time. 

It doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be "Yours".

If You hold back and stifle Yourself, fearing disapproval, whether that is from humans or even that of God, You are going to be stuck in Your current stage of development. 

The only way You can grow Your relationship with The Truth is through the process of speaking that which is Yours.

Even if that means telling someone You love to go to hell or off themselves. We have to be honest and truthful. When we stifle Ourselves for fear, We limit Ourselves and those around Us.

It's only through the battle of Truth that a higher Truth can Be obtained!

May the Most Beautiful Truth win!!!
